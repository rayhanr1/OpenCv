Variety of computer vision pograms using OpenCv

1)DocumentScanner.py : 
  This program uses a live video feed from a webcam to detect a sheet of paper, warp the image, and then allow the user to save it as a pdf by pressing 's'   

2)FacesImages.py : 
  Using the built in OpenCv FaceCascade, this program can detect the faces in images

3)FacesLiveFeed.py : 
  Same concept as #2, but the image this time is from the webcam and the program tracks faces in real time

4)LivePainting.py : 
  Currently set to Orange, this program lets the user define painting colors and then draws over the video feed when that color is detected

5)ShapeDetector.py : 
  This program takes an image of shapes as an input and uses image processing and contours to detect what types of shapes are present
